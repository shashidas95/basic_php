fopen

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)
fopen — Opens file or URL

Description ¶

fopen(
    string $filename,
    string $mode,
    bool $use_include_path = false,
    ?resource $context = null
): resource|false
fopen() binds a named resource, specified by filename, to a stream.

Parameters ¶

filename
If filename is of the form "scheme://...", it is assumed to be a URL and PHP will search for a protocol handler (also known as a wrapper) for that scheme. If no wrappers for that protocol are registered, PHP will emit a notice to help you track potential problems in your script and then continue as though filename specifies a regular file.

If PHP has decided that filename specifies a local file, then it will try to open a stream on that file. The file must be accessible to PHP, so you need to ensure that the file access permissions allow this access. If you have enabled open_basedir further restrictions may apply.

If PHP has decided that filename specifies a registered protocol, and that protocol is registered as a network URL, PHP will check to make sure that allow_url_fopen is enabled. If it is switched off, PHP will emit a warning and the fopen call will fail.

Note:
The list of supported protocols can be found in Supported Protocols and Wrappers. Some protocols (also referred to as wrappers) support context and/or php.ini options. Refer to the specific page for the protocol in use for a list of options which can be set. (e.g. php.ini value user_agent used by the http wrapper).
On the Windows platform, be careful to escape any backslashes used in the path to the file, or use forward slashes.

 <?php
$handle = fopen("c:\\folder\\resource.txt", "r");
?>
mode
The mode parameter specifies the type of access you require to the stream. It may be any of the following:

A list of possible modes for fopen() using mode
mode	Description
'r'	Open for reading only; place the file pointer at the beginning of the file.
'r+'	Open for reading and writing; place the file pointer at the beginning of the file.
'w'	Open for writing only; place the file pointer at the beginning of the file and truncate the file to zero length. If the file does not exist, attempt to create it.
'w+'	Open for reading and writing; otherwise it has the same behavior as 'w'.
'a'	Open for writing only; place the file pointer at the end of the file. If the file does not exist, attempt to create it. In this mode, fseek() has no effect, writes are always appended.
'a+'	Open for reading and writing; place the file pointer at the end of the file. If the file does not exist, attempt to create it. In this mode, fseek() only affects the reading position, writes are always appended.
'x'	Create and open for writing only; place the file pointer at the beginning of the file. If the file already exists, the fopen() call will fail by returning false and generating an error of level E_WARNING. If the file does not exist, attempt to create it. This is equivalent to specifying O_EXCL|O_CREAT flags for the underlying open(2) system call.
'x+'	Create and open for reading and writing; otherwise it has the same behavior as 'x'.
'c'	Open the file for writing only. If the file does not exist, it is created. If it exists, it is neither truncated (as opposed to 'w'), nor the call to this function fails (as is the case with 'x'). The file pointer is positioned on the beginning of the file. This may be useful if it's desired to get an advisory lock (see flock()) before attempting to modify the file, as using 'w' could truncate the file before the lock was obtained (if truncation is desired, ftruncate() can be used after the lock is requested).
'c+'	Open the file for reading and writing; otherwise it has the same behavior as 'c'.
'e'	Set close-on-exec flag on the opened file descriptor. Only available in PHP compiled on POSIX.1-2008 conform systems.

/* clearstatcache

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)
clearstatcache — Clears file status cache

Description ¶

clearstatcache(bool $clear_realpath_cache = false, string $filename = ""): void
When you use stat(), lstat(), or any of the other functions listed in the affected functions list (below), PHP caches the information those functions return in order to provide faster performance. However, in certain cases, you may want to clear the cached information. For instance, if the same file is being checked multiple times within a single script, and that file is in danger of being removed or changed during that script's operation, you may elect to clear the status cache. In these cases, you can use the clearstatcache() function to clear the information that PHP caches about a file.

You should also note that PHP doesn't cache information about non-existent files. So, if you call file_exists() on a file that doesn't exist, it will return false until you create the file. If you create the file, it will return true even if you then delete the file. However unlink() clears the cache automatically.

Note:
This function caches information about specific filenames, so you only need to call clearstatcache() if you are performing multiple operations on the same filename and require the information about that particular file to not be cached.
Affected functions include stat(), lstat(), file_exists(), is_writable(), is_readable(), is_executable(), is_file(), is_dir(), is_link(), filectime(), fileatime(), filemtime(), fileinode(), filegroup(), fileowner(), filesize(), filetype(), and fileperms().

Parameters ¶

clear_realpath_cache
Whether to also clear the realpath cache.

filename
Clear the realpath cache for a specific filename only; only used if clear_realpath_cache is true.

Return Values ¶

No value is returned.

Examples ¶

Example #1 clearstatcache() example

 <?php
$file = 'output_log.txt';

function get_owner($file)
{
    $stat = stat($file);
    $user = posix_getpwuid($stat['uid']);
    return $user['name'];
}

$format = "UID @ %s: %s\n";

printf($format, date('r'), get_owner($file));

chown($file, 'ross');
printf($format, date('r'), get_owner($file));

clearstatcache();
printf($format, date('r'), get_owner($file));
